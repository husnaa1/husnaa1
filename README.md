##USER MANAGEMENT INTERFACE SPECIFICATION
Overview
The user management interface provides the ability to add, modify, enable/disable, and manage users for a system. The interface includes functionality to display existing users and create new ones. It is designed for administrative purposes and controls user access levels within the system.
 
Requirements
Functional Requirements:
•	Add New Users: Allow administrators to create new user accounts by providing necessary details (username, display name, phone, email, user roles).
•	Edit Users: Modify existing user details such as username, email, phone, and roles.
•	Enable/Disable Users: Toggle users between active and inactive states.
•	Filter Users: Display only active or inactive users based on a checkbox filter.
•	View Users: List all users with key information, such as username, email, and status (enabled/disabled).
•	Assign Roles: Assign one or more roles to users, such as Admin, SuperAdmin, or Guest.
Non-Functional Requirements:
•	Responsive Design: The interface should be usable across different devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
•	Role-Based Access Control: Ensure that only authorized personnel (e.g., admins) have access to the user management screen.
•	Error Handling: Ensure the system displays appropriate error messages if required fields are not filled or invalid data is entered.
 
UI Components
User List Table
•	Columns:
o	ID: Unique identifier for each user.

o	Email: The email address associated with the user.

•	Actions:
o	Clicking on a row in the user list should populate the right-hand form with the selected user’s details for editing.

•	Behavior:

o	Validation: If any required fields are missing, the user should be prompted to fill in the missing information with an error message.
Filters and Buttons:
•	Hide Disabled Users Checkbox: By default, this option should be unchecked, showing all users. If checked, the table should hide users marked as disabled.
•	New User Button: Clears the form on the right-hand side and prepares it for creating a new user.
•	Save User Button: Validates and submits the data for creating or updating a user.
